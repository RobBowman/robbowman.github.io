# PowerShell for MP3

I recently replaced my Mk7 Golf (Apple CarPlay included) with a Volvo V40. There's a lot to like about the Volvo, but the only Podcast app available is Stitcher, and its implementation is "woeful" - the choice adjective from a support request to the Stitcher team! Even Volvo seem almost embarrassed by it - see the note below "Tips for using Stitcher": [Volvo apology](http://support.volvocars.com/au/Pages/article.aspx?article=4c3971d01d260b67c0a801515d2e708f)

Currently, my favourite podcast is [Developer on Fire by Dave Rael](www.developeronfire.com). I've learned something from almost every one of the dozens of episodes that I've listened too so far. They almost make an hour's drive to a client site worthwhile!

I wanted a quick way to download all the episodes onto a USB stick - thankfully, the V40 supports rewind and resume of MP3 files. My googling turned up no quick wins so I posted a question on [SuperUser](https://superuser.com/questions/1249035/download-all-mp3-file-in-rss-feed). The answer lead me to the following post [The Persistent Weblog](https://phejndorf.wordpress.com/2011/04/20/download-from-an-rss-feed-with-powershell/) from which, I took the following PowerShell:

    $feed=[xml](New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString("http://developeronfire.com/rss.xml")
    foreach($i in $feed.rss.channel.item)
    {    
        $url = New-Object System.Uri($i.enclosure.url)
        $file = "D:\DoF\" + $url.Segments[–1]
  
        if (! (Test-Path $file))
        {
            $url.ToString()    
            (New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile($url, $file)
        }
    }
    Write-Host "Script finished. Press any key to continue …"
    $x = $host.UI.RawUI.ReadKey("NoEcho,IncludeKeyDown")

Perfect!
